- 👋 Hi, I’m @estebanthe3rd... wel Christopher actualy   
- 👀 I’m interested in ... concept design, now i'm ready to make them for real.
-  i brought you the single COB LED spotlight, then the first domestic grow bulbs which more than i'm proud of the 2 bulbs .
-  i'm proud of what i did for people in china who were losing their jobs and i, wel my product saved the company from closure and the lady who inherited the debt.
-  she brought me a cheque for £20,000 that i had to donate to a domestic animal charity caled cats protection.
- because it wasn't worth me keping as i'm disabled and my income is more than that for a year and I'd have lost my income.
- if i wasn't bed riden betwen surgeries i'd have done a lot more for my community with the money.
-  I want to earn enough money to buy a large bit of land grow my own fod and fuel and create a self sustainable green eco house using ground source recovery to mainatain a temperature of 12*C day and night.
-  id also use water turbines pumping the clean water from the rain water and water recycling system including multiple free falling white rapid water fals from the top of the building where it would be more enclosed but..
-  still open enough to do its job and create suction from the higher points where al the dust acumilates, in the sleeping areas and walk in wardrobes anywhere theres cotton material. there wouldnt be normal sofas in the building chez lounge.
- the dust particles bad smells polutants like benzine or smoke from the air al through the 6 floors above ground.
-   right through the 6 floors above ground when the water for the inside water wall water fall would be flushed below ground and out and round the foundations and back in via a flo system to generate electricity via 2 water turbines.
-   and once the rain water purification system has kept the water fresh for as long as posible depending on availability it would replace the water fall and the water reserves that would be going round the water fall.
-    being filtered and purified again until it used, the water reserve would top it up. we are talking gigantic reverse osmosis filters and uvc recycling and heat treating at final stages before made into drinking water.
-    with instant cold water instant cold soda water instant hot water and ice cube maker from boiled watertanks on the 4 subtereanian floors below ground from a floo. collecting al the second hand water and purifying it again.
-    only via another system that it would then be used to either flush the huan waste sewer pipes or be used to water plants grown to eat or to be used as medicine and my own tobacco ect.
-   it would fed outside water features and a water chanel designed to provide auto irigation for my crops and a pond that would be filtered in a way that uses the excrement from small goldfish and pond cleaning species such as water snails.
-    i'd allocate a section for the comon frog but it would be from an overflow to the compost peat alternative creating pond fed from the twin wall run maintaining the level of the fish pond.beneath the water feature the water run and the pond.
-     the al self cleaning bird bath to would be a concrete basin designed to colect the water and a flo to release the water through anotther water turbine and then to the waste sewer pipe where i'd place a 4th water turbinewhere the rainwater from the roof.
-  would be colected up and filtered and what isnt used quick enough in my home would also be dumped via the floo through the 4th turbine so 2 indors and 2 outside. the roof would be covoured in the most longlife efecient hard waring solar panels and the pwthway,
-  around the land and garage would also be made from solar rof panneling not to mention bracketing smal 12volt vertical wind turbines across the wals of the higher floors al round the buildings and the open plan jungle of a groundfloor with no wals at al apart from the water fals and the ones to w/c.
-  and solar paneling roofing on all the sheltered walkways around the land. thats what im going for.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...CAD, linux coding. building a raspbery pi super computer for mining crypto. soon i want to be learning electrical and mobile device repair to an oficial standard.
- as well as puting my concept designs into digital formats and creating presentation animated edited sales pitches that il wait to get recognition for.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... putting together a design and media tool that not only provides you with a comon interface or GUI whilst stil paying homage to the original creators and the software that wil be making this al in one solution where it wil remain a .org platform.
- only once the components have ben mackled together withing the project manager app in the corect order chronologicaly based on your checklist which wil alow the AI tuition to help you and guide you as painlesly as posible through the design process.
-  after that will come the presentation of your products which you wil want to do a complete run through as wel as advertisments and a prototype to show. but my intentions were that people could be acepting financial suport prior to any of this being ready depending on what descripto or prototype you already had
